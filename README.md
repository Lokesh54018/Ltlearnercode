# Uber Data Analytics  | Modern Data Engineering Gcp Project

## Introduction
This Uber Data Analytics project showcases a modern data engineering pipeline built on Google Cloud Platform. We leverage tools like Mage.ai for orchestration, Cloud Storage for raw data ingestion, and BigQuery for scalable data warehousing. The insights are visualized through Looker Studio, enabling real-time, data-driven decision-making.
